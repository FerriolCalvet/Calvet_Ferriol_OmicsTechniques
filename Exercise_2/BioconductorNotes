Bioconductor has a phylosophy of sharing.

Open source software for bioinformatics
Now it has over 3000 projects.

Provide access to powerful and new statistical and graphical methods for omics data.

There are 4 different types of packages:
    Software
    AnnotationData
            for example information about the platform used for the experiment
    ExperimentData
    Workflow
            Series of steps related to an analysis or process


Main advantage of OOP, is that we can encapsulate objects like data structures and functions. Data structures would be the classes, and the functions would be the methods.

This allows us to work in a more classified way, and conceptually easier.

An instance of a class is a variable of the type of that class.
    methods are able to adapt to the class type that is calling them.


Class ExpressionSet, intended to store all the information of a microarray experiment.
With the knowledge of this class we will already be familiar with lots of things in Bioconductor.

ExpressionSet class:
    Used for microarrays, RNAseq, proteomics, metabolomics

    MIAME (Minimum information about a microarray experiment)
    Annotation: any particular annotation
